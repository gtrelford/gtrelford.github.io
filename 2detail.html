  <h2 class="mb-3" id="summary">Summary</h2>
  <p><b>The Life Tenancy Dispute and Solicitor Negligence</b></p>

  <p>In April 2016, my father made it explicitly clear to his solicitor that he wanted his sons to benefit from his estate without delay. He didn’t want us to wait for his former partner to pass away in order to receive our inheritance. His plan was simple and reasonable: we would have access to the property at Kenan Drive after a two-year period, allowing us to use or sell the house as we saw fit. This arrangement was meant to provide security for our future while respecting his former partner’s temporary occupancy.</p>
  
  <p>However, a significant and troubling change occurred just two months later. After prolonged pressure around the subject of marriage, erupting in a row with his former partner, my father came to his solicitor for advice. An amendment was then added to the will, intended to protect the estate from inheritance tax and to be implemented if—and only if—he married. This condition was clearly understood by my father and articulated to family and friends, and it was documented in the solicitor’s notes. Despite these clear instructions, the solicitor omitted this key condition from an overly complicated and difficult to navigate final will, an act of alleged negligence, among others, uncovered by a subsequent investigation by another solicitor.</p> 
  <!-- to add about the solicitor stating Aston may not be able to understand all the legalese in the will but to trust that his wishes had been captured -->
  
  <p><b>Consequences of Negligence</b></p>
  
  <p>Due to the solicitor's failure to include the "if" marriage clause, we now face severe consequences that my father sought to prevent. Paradoxically, despite his efforts to resist marriage to protect us from this exact situation, his worst fears have materialized because of this legal oversight. The situation is further aggravated by the trust mechanism being inappropriate without a marriage, exposing the property to inheritance tax that could have otherwise been covered by our mother's allowance. Moreover, his former partner, despite being presented with alternative trust options, has allowed this tax liability to persist and has refused to follow my father's letter of wishes regarding tax planning advice.</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><b>Extended Life Tenancy</b>: Aston's former partner has resided in the property for seven years—five years longer than originally intended—without paying rent, amounting to a low estimate of £105,500 based on a rate of £1,750 per month for five years. My father’s explicit instruction for a two-year tenancy has been disregarded, and this situation could potentially continue indefinitely.</li>
  <li><b>Tax Liability</b>: We now face a tax liability of up to approx. £140,000, a burden that would have been avoided with the inclusion of the missing marriage clause. Despite my father’s wishes on tax planning and being presented with alternative trust options, his former partner refused to address this.</li>
  <li><b>Financial and Personal Strain</b>: Aston's former partner has fought through her solicitor over several months to avoid covering expenses my father expected them to pay during the two year period, following which they have only agreed to pay some of the ongoing expenses but not others. 7 years worth of these expenses have had to be paid for by ourselves. I am currently negoitiating for access to property specifically left to us, including family heirlooms and sentimental items, despite these being left specifically to us and expected to be received after the two-year period. On top of this, his former partner has launched personal attacks against me, leveraging family and friends to create division. However, I believe that all family and friends have been able to see through this gas lighting and testimonials will be added to this website.</li>
  <li><b>Administrative Burden</b>: House inspections and buildings insurance must be administered annually, and over the last year and ongoing, additional hours are spent weekly on a flood claim. This burden, along with the potential for further claims, the eventual wrapping up of the estate, and unforeseen tasks, will persist for as long as the situation remains. </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>This situation is more than just a legal battle—it has become emotionally draining and deeply personal. If this continues unchecked, we could potentially be facing these issues for 20 years or more. Worse still, this burden could be passed on to our children if we were to pass away before this is resolved.</p>
  
  <p><b>The Core Issue: Negligence and Its Impact</b></p>
  
  <p>At the heart of this case is a simple fact: my father made a will, and then two months later, after arguments with his former partner, he amended it to protect the estate from inheritance tax in case he married. The key condition—“if he married”—was omitted, creating a situation that has spiraled out of control. This omission has led to extended tenancy, significant financial burden, and emotional stress for our family.</p>
  
  <p>The solicitor’s alleged negligence in failing to include this condition has created a legal nightmare, leaving us trapped in an unintended and perverse situation.</p>
  
  <p><b>Goals of This Campaign</b></p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><b>Extend the Time to Sue for Solicitor Negligence</b>: The law should provide more time than the current two years for families to sue solicitors for negligence in cases like this. When mistakes or their extended implications only become apparent years later, families who are already grieving and facing additional stress due to negligence need a longer window to seek justice and hold legal professionals accountable. Furthermore, there should be greater legal support for families placed in this position through no fault of their own.</li>
  <li><b>Raise Awareness of Solicitor Negligence</b>: It’s crucial to highlight how easily solicitors’ mistakes can impact families and demonstrate how negligence in drafting a will can lead to long-term financial and emotional repercussions. Furthermore, the complexity of unsuitable trust mechanisms and the ongoing administration costs associated with them serve as revenue-generating aspects for solicitors, motivating the recommendation of these solutions without adequate warnings of the risks.</li>
  <li><b>Encourage Others to Fight Back</b>: My message to others is simple: if you’re in a similar situation, don’t be bullied into submission. Fight for your rights. You don’t deserve to suffer due to legal negligence. Stand up for what is right, and don’t sit back while others exploit legal mistakes and dishonour the memory of your loved ones.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p><b>Moral Implications</b></p>
  
  <p>Aston's former partner’s behavior, coupled with the solicitor’s alleged negligence, goes beyond a simple legal matter. Morally, this situation is akin to receiving stolen goods, but it is far worse. The financial implications are staggering, and the true victims are my father’s own family, who must bear the emotional and financial burdens indefinitely. Those affected are the very individuals he loved and sought to protect and who loved and supported him unconditionally. The former partner’s refusal to adhere to my father’s wishes, combined with the solicitor’s failure to carry out his clear instructions, has resulted in a situation that is both unjust and fundamentally wrong.</p>
  
  <p><b>Evidence and Testimony</b></p>
  
  <p>This case is not based on speculation. Don’t just take my word for it—on this website, you will find the evidence that supports our claims:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><b>Original Transcription from the Solicitor</b>: My father’s words, as transcribed by the solicitor, clearly express his intention to protect the estate from tax if he married, and to ensure his sons benefited from the estate without delay.</li>
  <li><b>Testimony from Family and Friends</b>: Many of my father’s closest friends and family can attest to the conversations they had with him about his will and his clear intentions.</li>
  <li><b>Documented Notes from Meetings</b>: The solicitor’s own notes from the time of the will’s amendment show that my father’s wishes were well understood but not properly executed.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>* * *</p>
  
  <p><b>Conclusion: A Call to Action</b></p>
  
  <p>My father made his wishes clear; however, due to a solicitor’s alleged negligence, we find ourselves trapped in a situation he desperately sought to avoid by entrusting what he believed were experts. This campaign aims to rectify that injustice by shedding light on the issue, holding the responsible parties accountable, and encouraging others in similar situations to come forward.</p>
  
  <p>We are not only fighting for justice for ourselves but for anyone who has suffered from solicitor negligence in estate planning. Let’s ensure no family is ever placed in such a damaging, unfair, and prolonged situation again.</p>

  <h2 class="mb-3" id="detailedbreakdown">Detailed Breakdown</h2>

  <p>A detailed breakdown of every key event, supported by evidence, testimonial data, contemporaneous notes, and later reflections, will be provided.</p> 
  <p><i>This section is a work in progress but will include:</i></p> 
  <p>- Texts and emails that clearly demonstrate that his former partner was fully aware of the expectation that two out of three trustees had the authority to terminate the tenancy at any time.</p> 
  <p>- Communications revealing the division his former partner actively sowed between my father and his first son and family.</p> 
  <p style="padding-left:20px">"[...]Gareth and I are in your corner Team Aston for Triumph! I am sure 2 out of 3 executors will take away [sway] [...]" (Tue, Jan 24, 2017, 7:13 AM)</p> 
  <p>This single message, sent less than a month before Aston passed away, clearly demonstrates his former partner’s awareness of the two-out-of-three executors’ authority. It also highlights the intentional division created between "Team Aston" (which included myself) and my father’s other son and family, who were cast as adversaries.</p> 
  <p>- Emails indicate that the solicitor received contact from his former partner but failed to make any relevant notes. This leaves us uncertain whether Aston's primary concern was properly communicated by his former partner. Moreover, the solicitor's reply clearly does not address this central issue directly.</p>
<p style="padding-left:20px">
  Tues 1/24/2017 09:36am<br/>
  <i>Dear Aston,<br/>

  [Solicitor A] has asked me to email you directly concerning your will. I understand you have a query about the appointment of executors?<br/>

  I confirm that you appoint your sons, [Son A] and Gareth, with the partners of our firm, [Solicitor Firm], to be your executors. They will also become trustees of the flexible life interest trust over your residuary estate. Your <b>letter of wishes explains</b> that you would like to give your partner a <b>life interest in your property</b> and the rest of the estate, if any, should be given to your sons. Although the supporting <b>letter of wishes is not binding</b>, the trustees will follow your wishes as best they can in light of the circumstances prevailing at the time and, as professional trustees, please be rest assured our firm will oversee this matter to help protect the interests of all your chosen beneficiaries including the life interest in the property for your partner.<br/>

  I hope this helps to clarify the matter. Please don't hesitate to contact me if I can be of further assistance to you.<br/>
                
  Kind regards
  </i>
</p><p>
  The response is misleading by conflating the contents of the will with the intentions expressed in my father's wishes. This blurs the line between what is legally binding and what was meant as guidance, giving the false impression that the life tenancy, merely being mentioned in the wishes, is not enforceable. The key points are emphasized in bold: Aston clearly felt too unwell to personally contact the solicitor by phone. However, assuming he could comprehend the reply, it likely reinforced what he already believed from prior conversations and emails—namely, that because he had resisted marrying his partner, the trustees retained an overriding power (by a 2-to-1 agreement) to determine the future of the property. This aligns with what my father told me at the time: his former partner had expressed concerns about being evicted before the two-year period ended, but my father trusted me to respect his wishes in any dispute, which I naturally would have done.
</p>
<p>
  Given that the investigation revealed the solicitor had allegedly been advising Aston on tax matters, it is highly unlikely that Aston was knowingly exposed to the tax liability. The root cause of this issue lies in the omission of the marriage clause. Regardless of whether the tax liability was foreseen, this also represents a missed opportunity to address the matter in light of Aston’s declining health and the fact that he never married.
</p>
<p>
  Furthermore, to try and resolve the tax liability issue in the months after Aston's passing, the solicitor provided two alternative options to his former partner, even offering this work free of charge. However, when his former partner soon rejected both options, the solicitor then requested to step down from their role in the trust—effectively washing their hands of the alleged errors. This makes a mockery of their earlier statement: "...as professional trustees, please be rest assured our firm will oversee this matter to help protect the interests of all your chosen beneficiaries..."
</p>

  <p>- Messages from his former partner reveal a clear cognitive dissonance: on one hand, they praised me effusively, while on the other, they actively sought to create division within the family. This was soon followed by hostile emails sent behind my back to family friends, further deepening the conflict.</p>
