  <p><b>The Life Tenancy Dispute and Solicitor Negligence</b></p>

  <p>In April 2016, my father made it explicitly clear that he wanted his sons to benefit from his estate without delay. He didn’t want us to wait for the life tenant to pass away in order to receive our inheritance. His plan was simple and reasonable: we would have access to the property at Kenan Drive after a two-year period, allowing us to use or sell the house as we saw fit. This arrangement was meant to provide security for our future while respecting the life tenant’s temporary occupancy.</p>
  
  <p>However, a significant and troubling change occurred just three months later. After prolonged pressure around the subject of marriage, erupting in a row with the life tenant, my father came to his solicitor for advice. An amendment was then added to the will, intended to protect the estate from inheritance tax and to be implemented if—and only if—he married. This condition was clearly understood by my father and articulated to family and friends, and it was documented in the solicitor’s notes and subsequent email. Despite these clear instructions, the solicitor omitted this key condition from an overly complicated and difficult to navigate final will, an act of alleged negligence, among others, uncovered by a subsequent investigation by another solicitor.</p> 
  <!-- to add about the solicitor stating Aston may not be able to understand all the legalese in the will but to trust that his wishes had been captured -->
  
  <p><b>Consequences of Negligence</b></p>
  
  <p>Due to the solicitor’s failure to include the “if” marriage clause, we now face severe consequences that my father had fought to prevent. Paradoxically, despite resisting marriage to protect us from this exact situation, his worst fears were realized due to legal oversight. The situation has been further worsened by the fact that the married person allowance wasn’t carried out, and the life tenant, despite having options, has refused to follow my father’s wishes to mitigate the tax burden.</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><b>Extended Life Tenancy</b>: The life tenant has been living in the property for seven years—five years longer than originally intended. My father’s clear instruction for a two-year period has been ignored.</li>
  <li><b>Tax Liability</b>: We now face a tax liability of up to £140,000, a burden that could have been avoided if the solicitor had not been negligent. The life tenant has done nothing to address this, despite my father’s wishes and being presented with alternative trust options.</li>
  <li><b>Financial and Personal Strain</b>: The life tenant has fought over several months to avoid covering expenses my father expected them to pay during the two year period, following which they have only agreed to pay some of the ongoing expenses but not others. 7 years worth of these expenses have had to be paid for by ourselves. I am currently negoitiating for access to property specifically left to us, including family heirlooms and sentimental items, despite these being left specifically to us and expected to be received after the two-year period. On top of this, the life tenant has launched personal attacks against me, leveraging family and friends to create division. However, I believe that all family and friends have been able to see through this gas lighting and testimonials will be added to this website.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>This situation is more than just a legal battle—it has become emotionally draining and deeply personal. If this continues unchecked, we could potentially be facing these issues for 20 years or more. Worse still, this burden could be passed on to our children if we were to pass away before this is resolved.</p>
  
  <p><b>The Core Issue: Negligence and Its Impact</b></p>
  
  <p>At the heart of this case is a simple fact: my father made a will, and then three months later, after arguments with the life tenant, he amended it to protect the estate from inheritance tax in case he married. The key condition—“if he married”—was omitted, creating a situation that has spiraled out of control. This omission has led to extended tenancy, significant financial burden, and emotional stress for our family.</p>
  
  <p>The solicitor’s negligence in failing to include this condition has created a legal nightmare, leaving us trapped in an unintended and perverse situation.</p>
  
  <p><b>Goals of This Campaign</b></p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><b>Extend the Time to Sue for Solicitor Negligence</b>: The law should allow more time to sue solicitors for negligence in cases like this. When such mistakes only become apparent years after the fact, families need a longer window to seek justice and hold legal professionals accountable.</li>
  <li><b>Raise Awareness of Solicitor Negligence</b>: It’s crucial to expose how easily solicitors’ mistakes can harm families, and to show how negligence in drafting a will can have long-term financial and emotional consequences.</li>
  <li><b>Encourage Others to Fight Back</b>: My message to others is simple: if you’re in a similar situation, don’t be bullied into submission. Fight for your rights. You don’t deserve to suffer due to legal negligence. Stand up for what is right, and don’t let others take advantage of your family’s inheritance.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p><b>Moral Implications</b></p>
  
  <p>The life tenant’s behavior, coupled with the solicitor’s negligence, goes beyond a simple legal issue. Morally, this is akin to receiving stolen goods but much worse. The sums of money involved are eye-watering and it’s not some corporation or anonymous entity that has suffered; it’s my father’s own family. The victims here are the people he loved and intended to protect. The life tenant’s refusal to follow my father’s wishes and the solicitor’s failure to carry out his clear instructions have resulted in a situation that is unjust and fundamentally wrong.</p>
  
  <p><b>Evidence and Testimony</b></p>
  
  <p>This case is not based on speculation. Don’t just take my word for it—on this website, you will find the evidence that supports our claims:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><b>Original Transcription from the Solicitor</b>: My father’s words, as transcribed by the solicitor, clearly express his intention to protect the estate from tax if he married, and to ensure his sons benefited from the estate without delay.</li>
  <li><b>Testimony from Family and Friends</b>: Many of my father’s closest friends and family can attest to the conversations they had with him about his will and his clear intentions.</li>
  <li><b>Documented Notes from Meetings</b>: The solicitor’s own notes from the time of the will’s amendment show that my father’s wishes were well understood but not properly executed.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>* * *</p>
  
  <p><b>Conclusion: A Call to Action</b></p>
  
  <p>My father made his wishes clear, and yet due to a solicitor’s negligence, we have been trapped in a situation he fought so hard to prevent. This campaign seeks to right that wrong by bringing this issue to light, holding the responsible parties accountable, and encouraging others in similar situations to come forward.</p>
  
  <p>We are not only fighting for justice for ourselves but for anyone who has suffered from solicitor negligence in estate planning. Let’s ensure no family is ever placed in such a damaging, unfair, and prolonged situation again.</p>
